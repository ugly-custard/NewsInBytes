    "summary": "The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP) is in power at the center of Indian politics for the first time in more than a decade, and that could change if the country's Supreme Court rules in its favor. The court is hearing a challenge to a 2016 election law that allows the BJP and other parties to collect money from voters via \"electoral bonds,\" reports the Wall Street Journal. The bonds are supposed to be used to fund the party's campaign, but critics say they're being used to buy votes and influence elections. A lawyer for the opposition Congress Party has argued that most of the electoral bonds go to the BJP, while only around 1% go to other parties, reports the Times of India. The ruling party, however, says most of the electoral bonds go to state governments, not the opposition. If the court sides with the BJP, it could have a huge impact on how elections are held in the country.",
